## Running

We decided that it's best to keep 2 passes separated so that our software is more modular and easier to maintain and develop. So to run part3, you just need to pass both passes to `opt`:

> [!NOTE]  
> Please follow through previous [2 parts](https://github.com/ncsu-csc512-project/) to get the .so files for each pass.
> Part 1's Makefile also contains convenient commands to install LLVM 17 and setting up the environment (just run `make || make` on a **clean** VCL machine).

```bash
# don't just copy and run! replace $VARIABLES with your own values
# use opt-17 & clang-17 if you come from part 1
opt -load-pass-plugin $PATH_TO_PART1_REPO/build/BranchPointerPass/libBranchPointerPass.so $PATH_TO_PART2_REPO/build/libDefUseAnalysisPass.so -passes=branch-pointer-pass,def-use-analysis inputs/input.ll  # replace with your own .ll file emitted by clang


```

## Test C programs

They are located in `./tests` directory, all from the [TheAlgorithms/C](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C) repository, and are real-world programs, each program is around 700 lines.

Please note that they require C standard of at least C99.
